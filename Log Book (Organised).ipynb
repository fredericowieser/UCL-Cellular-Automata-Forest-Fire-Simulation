    "### Theory Behind Cellular Automata\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory behind a CA was first ever thought about and discovered by John von Neumann in the 1940s[2]. It was not until the 1970s that people outside of the realm of academia even gave this subject much thought, which was due to the creation of Conway's Game of Life, which is one of the most famous CA ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every CA is essetially the same in terms of it's general structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Begin with a grid of some sort. This grid can have as many dimensions as you may want. Their should be multiple points in this grid where a value can be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Begining with an initial state of the grid, known as your initial CA. Where each point in our CA is assigned a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the next state of the CA using a mathematical function or algorithm which you have chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Store this new grid of values, which known as your current CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use you current CA as your initial CA and repeat step 3 for as long as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essentially how a CA works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing it is important to get terminology out of the way:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule:** The whole description of how a cell will be updated based on the configuration of its neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **States:** The number of components of each CA rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline of All Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create Initial State\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write an update function, which will take the list of cell values at time step $n$ and return the values at time step $n+1$\n",

Refering to online resources will likely be the best way to learn and get the actual programming done."
